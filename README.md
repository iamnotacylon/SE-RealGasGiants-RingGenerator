# SE-RealGasGiants-RingGenerator
 To use this generator, simply make sure you have the relevant python3 packages installed, and run ring_gen.py with python. 
 
 This will generate 5 png files. If you don't like all or some of them, they can be re-rolled by running the program again. Any that you mostly like and think you can hand-tune the rest of the way can be edited in your favorite graphics editor.

 When you're ready to finalize your images into a mod usable in space engineers with RealGasGiants, simply open the images you like with Paint.NET (https://www.getpaint.net/) and "Save As" a .dds file; make sure to select "BC7 (sRGB, DX 11+)", "Cube Map from crossed image", "Generate Mip Maps", "Bicubic (Smooth)", and "Use gamma correction" selected. 
 
 While other, but not all, dds generation settings will work, we have found this to work as well as the others, and it's easier to simply have one set of instructions. We recommend paint.net over the image converter distributed with space engineers simply because there's nothing to learn about using it first, and you don't need to use the windows command line, which many dislike.
